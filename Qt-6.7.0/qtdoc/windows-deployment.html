<div class="descr" id="details">
<p>This documentation describes deployment process for <a href="windows.html" translate="no">Windows</a>. We refer to the <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/tests/manual/examples/widgets/tools/plugandpaint/app?h=6.7" translate="no">Plug &amp; Paint</a> example application through out the document to demonstrate the deployment process.</p>

<h2 id="the-windows-deployment-tool">The Windows Deployment Tool</h2>
<span id="windeployqt"></span><p>The Windows deployment tool <code translate="no">windeployqt</code> is designed to automate the process of creating a deployable folder containing the <a href="../qmake/qmake-variable-reference.html#qt" translate="no">Qt</a>-related dependencies (libraries, QML imports, plugins, and translations) required to run the application from that folder. It creates an installation tree for Windows desktop applications, which can be easily bundled into an installation package.</p>
<p>The tool can be found in <code translate="no">QTDIR/bin/windeployqt</code>. It needs to be run within the build environment in order to function correctly. When using Qt Online Installer, the script <code translate="no">QTDIR/bin/qtenv2.bat</code> should be used to set it up.</p>
<p><code translate="no">windeployqt</code> takes an <code translate="no">.exe</code> file or a directory that contains an <code translate="no">.exe</code> file as an argument, and scans the executable for dependencies. If a directory is passed with the <code translate="no">--qmldir</code> argument, <code translate="no">windeployqt</code> uses the <code translate="no">qmlimportscanner</code> tool to scan QML files inside the directory for QML import dependencies. Identified dependencies are then copied to the executable's directory.</p>
<p>In case Qt was built with the configure switch <code translate="no">-relocatable</code> turned off, <code translate="no">windeployqt</code> replaces the hardcoded local paths in Qt6Core.dll by relative ones.</p>
<p>For Windows desktop applications, the required runtime files for the compiler are also copied to the deployable folder by default (unless the option <code translate="no">--no-compiler-runtime</code> is specified). In the case of release builds using Microsoft Visual C++, these consist of the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages, which are intended for recursive installation by the application's installer on the target machine. Otherwise, the shared libraries of the compiler runtime are used.</p>
<p>The application may require additional 3rd-party libraries (for example, database libraries), which are not taken into account by windeployqt.</p>
<p>Additional arguments are described in the tools' help output:</p>

 Usage: windeployqt [options] [files]
 Qt Deploy Tool 6.0.0

 The simplest way to use windeployqt is to add the bin directory of your Qt
 installation (e.g. &lt;QT_DIR\bin&gt;) to the PATH variable and then run:
   windeployqt &lt;path-to-app-binary&gt;
 If ICU, etc. are not in the bin directory, they need to be in the PATH
 variable. If your application uses Qt Quick, run:
   windeployqt --qmldir &lt;path-to-app-qml-files&gt; &lt;path-to-app-binary&gt;

 Options:
   -?, -h, --help              Displays help on commandline options.

<h2 id="static-linking">Static Linking</h2>
<p>To build static applications, build Qt statically by configuring Qt with <code translate="no">-static</code>:</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 cd C:\path\to\<span class="type"><a href="../qtcore/qt.html" translate="no">Qt</a></span>
 configure <span class="operator">-</span><span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="operator">&lt;</span>any other options you need<span class="operator">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>If you later need to reconfigure and rebuild Qt from the same location, ensure that all traces of the previous configuration are removed by entering the build directory and running <code translate="no">nmake distclean</code> or <code translate="no">mingw32-make distclean</code> before running <code translate="no">configure</code> again.</p>
<h3 id="linking-the-application-to-the-static-version-of-qt">Linking the Application to the Static Version of Qt</h3>
<p>As an example, this section will build the <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/tests/manual/examples/widgets/tools/plugandpaint/app?h=6.7" translate="no">Plug &amp; Paint</a> example statically.</p>
<p>Once Qt finishes building, build the <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/tests/manual/examples/widgets/tools/plugandpaint/app?h=6.7" translate="no">Plug &amp; Paint</a> application. First we must go into the directory that contains the application:</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 cd examples\tools\plugandpaint
</pre>
<p>Run <code translate="no">qmake</code> to create a new makefile for the application, and perform a clean build to create the statically linked executable:</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 nmake clean
 qmake <span class="operator">-</span>config release
 nmake
</pre>
<p>You probably want to link against the release libraries, and you can specify this when invoking <code translate="no">qmake</code>. Now, provided that everything compiled and linked without any errors, we should have a <code translate="no">plugandpaint.exe</code> file that is ready for deployment. To check that the application has the required libraries, copy the executable to a machine that does not have Qt or any Qt applications installed, and run it on that machine.</p>
<p>Remember that if your application depends on compiler specific libraries, these must still be redistributed along with your application. You can check which libraries your application is linking against by using the <code translate="no">depends</code> tool. For more information, read the <a href="windows-deployment.html#application-dependencies" translate="no">Application Dependencies</a> section.</p>
<p>Since we cannot deploy plugins using the static linking approach, the application we have prepared is incomplete. It will run, but the functionality will be disabled due to the missing plugins. To deploy plugin-based applications we should use the shared library approach.</p>
<h2 id="shared-libraries">Shared Libraries</h2>
<p>We have two challenges when deploying the <code translate="no">plugandpaint</code> application using the shared libraries approach: The Qt runtime has to be correctly redistributed along with the application executable, and the plugins have to be installed in the correct location on the target system so that the application can find them.</p>
<h3 id="building-qt-as-a-shared-library">Building Qt as a Shared Library</h3>
<p>For this example, we assume that Qt is installed as a shared library, which is the default when installing Qt, in the <i>C:\path\to\Qt</i> directory.</p>
<h3 id="linking-the-application-to-qt-as-a-shared-library">Linking the Application to Qt as a Shared Library</h3>
<p>After ensuring that Qt is built as a shared library, we can build the <code translate="no">plugandpaint</code> application. First, we must go into the directory that contains the application:</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 cd examples\tools\plugandpaint
</pre>
<p>Now run <code translate="no">qmake</code> to create a new makefile for the application, and do a clean build to create the dynamically linked executable:</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 nmake clean
 qmake <span class="operator">-</span>config release
 nmake
</pre>
<p>This builds the core application, the following will build the plugins:</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 cd <span class="operator">.</span><span class="operator">.</span>\plugandpaint<span class="operator">/</span>plugins
 nmake clean
 qmake <span class="operator">-</span>config release
 nmake
</pre>
<p>If everything compiled and linked without any errors, we will get a <code translate="no">plugandpaint.exe</code> executable and the <code translate="no">pnp_basictools.dll</code> and <code translate="no">pnp_extrafilters.dll</code> plugin files.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-application-package">Creating the Application Package</h3>
<p>To deploy the application, we must make sure that we copy the relevant Qt DLLs (corresponding to the Qt modules used in the application) and the Windows platform plugin, <code translate="no">qwindows.dll</code>, as well as the executable to the same directory tree in the <code translate="no">release</code> subdirectory.</p>
<p>In contrast to user plugins, Qt plugins must be put into subdirectories matching the plugin type. The correct location for the platform plugin is a subdirectory named <code translate="no">platforms</code>. <a href="windows-deployment.html#qt-plugins" translate="no">Qt Plugins</a> section has additional information about plugins and how Qt searches for them.</p>
<p>If dynamic OpenGL is used, you may additionally want to include the library required software-based OpenGL, if the application is compatible with it.</p>
<p>If Qt was configured to link against ICU or OpenSSL, the respective DLL's need to be added to the <code translate="no">release</code> folder, too. But the binary packages for Qt on Windows do require this. For more details, see also <a href="third-party-libraries.html" translate="no">Third-Party Libraries</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that if your application depends on compiler specific libraries, these must be redistributed along with your application. You can check which libraries your application is linking against by using the <code translate="no">depends</code> tool. For more information, see the <a href="windows-deployment.html#application-dependencies" translate="no">Application Dependencies</a> section.</p>
<p>We'll cover the plugins shortly, but first we'll check that the application will work in a deployed environment: Either copy the executable and the Qt DLLs to a machine that doesn't have Qt or any Qt applications installed, or if you want to test on the build machine, ensure that the machine doesn't have Qt in its environment.</p>
<p>If the application starts without any problems, then we have successfully made a dynamically linked version of the <code translate="no">plugandpaint</code> application. But the application's functionality will still be missing since we have not yet deployed the associated plugins.</p>
<p>Plugins work differently to normal DLLs, so we can't just copy them into the same directory as our application's executable as we did with the Qt DLLs. When looking for plugins, the application searches in a <code translate="no">plugins</code> subdirectory inside the directory of the application executable.</p>
<p>So to make the plugins available to our application, we have to create the <code translate="no">plugins</code> subdirectory and copy over the relevant DLLs:</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 plugins\pnp_basictools<span class="operator">.</span>dll
 plugins\pnp_extrafilters<span class="operator">.</span>dll
</pre>
<p>An archive distributing all the Qt DLLs and application specific plugins required to run the <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/tests/manual/examples/widgets/tools/plugandpaint/app?h=6.7" translate="no">Plug &amp; Paint</a> application, would have to include the following files:</p>
<div class="table"><table class="generic" width="100%">
 <thead><tr class="qt-style"><th >Component</th><th  colspan="2" rowspan=" 1">File Name</th></tr></thead>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td >The executable</td><td  colspan="2" rowspan=" 1"><code translate="no">plugandpaint.exe</code></td></tr>

<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td >The ExtraFilters plugin</td><td  colspan="2" rowspan=" 1"><code translate="no">plugins\pnp_extrafilters.dll</code></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td >The Qt Windows platform plugin</td><td  colspan="2" rowspan=" 1"><code translate="no">platforms\qwindows.dll</code></td></tr>

<tr valign="top" class="even"><td >The Qt Core module</td><td  colspan="2" rowspan=" 1"><code translate="no">Qt6Core.dll</code></td></tr>

<tr valign="top" class="even"><td >The Qt Widgets module</td><td  colspan="2" rowspan=" 1"><code translate="no">Qt6Widgets.dll</code></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Other plugins might be required depending on the features the application uses (<code translate="no">iconengines</code>, <code translate="no">imageformats</code>).</p>
<p>In addition, the archive must contain the following compiler specific libraries (assuming Visual Studio 16 (2019)):</p>
<div class="table"><table class="generic" width="100%">
 <thead><tr class="qt-style"><th >Component</th><th  colspan="2" rowspan=" 1">File Name</th></tr></thead>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td >The C run-time</td><td  colspan="2" rowspan=" 1"><code translate="no">vcruntime140.dll</code></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td >The C++ run-time</td><td  colspan="2" rowspan=" 1"><code translate="no">msvcp160.dll</code></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>If dynamic OpenGL was used, then the archive may additionally contain:</p>
<div class="table"><table class="generic" width="100%">
 <thead><tr class="qt-style"><th >Component</th><th  colspan="2" rowspan=" 1">File Name</th></tr></thead>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td >OpenGL Software renderer library</td><td >opengl32sw.dll</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Finally, if Qt was configured to use ICU, the archive must contain:</p>
<div class="table"><table class="generic" width="100%">
 <thead><tr class="qt-style"><th  colspan="3">File Name</th></tr></thead>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td >icudtXX.dll</td><td >icuinXX.dll</td><td >icuucXX.dll</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>To verify that the application now can be successfully deployed, you can extract this archive on a machine without Qt and without any compiler installed, and try to run it.</p>
<p>An alternative to putting the plugins in the plugins subdirectory is to add a custom search path when you start your application using <a href="../qtcore/qcoreapplication.html#addLibraryPath" translate="no">QCoreApplication::addLibraryPath</a>() or <a href="../qtcore/qcoreapplication.html#setLibraryPaths" translate="no">QCoreApplication::setLibraryPaths</a>().</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 <span class="type"><a href="../qtcore/qcoreapplication.html" translate="no">QCoreApplication</a></span><span class="operator">::</span>addLibraryPath(<span class="string">&quot;C:/some/other/path&quot;</span>);
</pre>
<p>One benefit of using plugins is that they can easily be made available to a whole family of applications.</p>
<p>It's often most convenient to add the path in the application's <code translate="no">main()</code> function, right after the <a href="../qtwidgets/qapplication.html" translate="no">QApplication</a> object is created. Once the path is added, the application will search it for plugins, in addition to looking in the <code translate="no">plugins</code> subdirectory in the application's own directory. Any number of additional paths can be added.</p>
<h3 id="manifest-files">Manifest files</h3>
<p>When deploying an application compiled with Visual Studio, there are some additional steps to be taken.</p>
<p>First, we need to copy the manifest file created when linking the application. This manifest file contains information about the application's dependencies on side-by-side assemblies, such as the runtime libraries.</p>
<p>The manifest file needs to be copied into the <b>same</b> folder as the application executable. You do not need to copy the manifest files for shared libraries (DLLs), since they are not used.</p>
<p>If the shared library has dependencies that are different from the application using it, the manifest file needs to be embedded into the DLL binary. The following <code translate="no">CONFIG</code> options are available for embedding manifests:</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 embed_manifest_dll
 embed_manifest_exe
</pre>
<p>Both options are enabled by default. To remove <code translate="no">embed_manifest_exe</code>, add</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 CONFIG -= embed_manifest_exe
</pre>
<p>to your .pro file.</p>
<p>You can find more information about manifest files and side-by-side assemblies at the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//aa376307(v=vs.85)" translate="no">Side-by-side Assemblies documentation page</a>.</p>
<p>The correct way to include the runtime libraries with your application is to ensure that they are installed on the end-user's system.</p>
<p>To install the runtime libraries on the end-user's system, you need to include the appropriate Visual C++ Redistributable Package (VCRedist) executable with your application and ensure that it is executed when the user installs your application.</p>
<p>The redistributable is named <code translate="no">vc_redist.x64.exe</code> (64-bit) and can be found in the folder <code translate="no">&lt;Visual Studio install path&gt;/VC/redist/&lt;language-code&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it can be downloaded from the web, for example <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads" translate="no">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads</a>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p><b>Note: </b>The application you ship must be compiled with exactly the same compiler version against the same C runtime version. This prevents deploying errors caused by different versions of the C runtime libraries.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="application-dependencies">Application Dependencies</h2>
<h3 id="additional-libraries">Additional Libraries</h3>
<p>Depending on configuration, compiler specific libraries must be redistributed along with your application.</p>
<p>You can check which libraries your application is linking against by using the <a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/" translate="no">Dependency Walker</a> tool. All you need to do is to run it like this:</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 depends <span class="operator">&lt;</span>application executable<span class="operator">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>This will provide a list of the libraries that your application depends on and other information.</p>
<p>When looking at the release build of the Plug &amp; Paint executable (<code translate="no">plugandpaint.exe</code>) with the <code translate="no">depends</code> tool, the tool lists the following immediate dependencies to non-system libraries:</p>
<div class="table"><table class="generic" width="100%">

</table></div>
<p>When looking at the plugin DLLs the exact same dependencies are listed.</p>
<h3 id="qt-plugins">Qt Plugins</h3>
<p>All Qt GUI applications require a plugin that implements the <a href="../qtplatformintegration/qpa.html" translate="no">Qt Platform Abstraction</a> (QPA) layer in Qt. For Windows, the name of the platform plugin is <code translate="no">qwindows.dll</code>. This file must be located within a specific subdirectory (by default, <code translate="no">platforms</code>) under your distribution directory. Alternatively, it is possible to adjust the search path Qt uses to find its plugins, as described below.</p>
<p>Your application may also depend on one or more Qt plugins, such as the print support plugin, the JPEG image format plugin or a SQL driver plugin. Be sure to distribute any Qt plugins that you need with your application. Similar to the platform plugin, each type of plugin must be located within a specific subdirectory (such as <code translate="no">printsupport</code>, <code translate="no">imageformats</code> or <code translate="no">sqldrivers</code>) within your distribution directory.</p>
<p>The libraries are relocatable unless Qt was built with the configure switch <code translate="no">-relocatable</code> turned off. The search paths for Qt plugins are relative to the location of the <a href="../qtcore/qtcore-module.html" translate="no">QtCore</a> library and no further steps are required to ensure plugins are found after installing the application on the target machine.</p>
<h3 id="ensuring-plugins-are-found-when-using-non-relocatable-builds">Ensuring Plugins Are Found when Using Non-Relocatable Builds</h3>
<p>For non-relocatable builds, additional steps must be taken to ensure plugins are found after the application has been installed on the target machine.</p>
<p>In this case, the search path for Qt plugins is hard-coded into the <a href="../qtcore/qtcore-module.html" translate="no">QtCore</a> library. By default, the plugins subdirectory of the Qt installation is the first plugin search path. However, pre-determined paths like the default one have certain disadvantages. For example, they may not exist on the target machine. For that reason, you need to examine various alternatives to make sure that the Qt plugins are found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="qt-conf.html" translate="no">Using <code translate="no">qt.conf</code></a>. This approach is the recommended if you have executables in different places sharing the same plugins.</li>
<li>Using <a href="../qtcore/qcoreapplication.html#addLibraryPath" translate="no">QApplication::addLibraryPath</a>() or <a href="../qtcore/qcoreapplication.html#setLibraryPaths" translate="no">QApplication::setLibraryPaths</a>(). This approach is recommended if you only have one executable that will use the plugin.</li>
<li>Using a third party installation utility to change the hard-coded paths in the <a href="../qtcore/qtcore-module.html" translate="no">QtCore</a> library.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you add a custom path using QApplication::addLibraryPath it could look like this:</p>
<pre class="cpp" translate="no">
 <span class="type"><a href="../qtcore/qcoreapplication.html" translate="no">QCoreApplication</a></span><span class="operator">::</span>addLibraryPath(<span class="string">&quot;C:/customPath/plugins&quot;</span>);
</pre>
<p>Then <a href="../qtcore/qcoreapplication.html#libraryPaths" translate="no">QCoreApplication::libraryPaths</a>() would return something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code translate="no">C:/customPath/plugins</code></li>
<li><code translate="no">C:/Qt/%VERSION%/plugins</code></li>
<li><code translate="no">E:/myApplication/directory</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The executable will look for the plugins in these directories and the same order as the <a href="../qtcore/qstringlist.html" translate="no">QStringList</a> returned by <a href="../qtcore/qcoreapplication.html#libraryPaths" translate="no">QCoreApplication::libraryPaths</a>(). The newly added path is prepended to the <a href="../qtcore/qcoreapplication.html#libraryPaths" translate="no">QCoreApplication::libraryPaths</a>() which means that it will be searched through first. However, if you use <a href="../qtcore/qcoreapplication.html#setLibraryPaths" translate="no">QCoreApplication::setLibraryPaths</a>(), you will be able to determine which paths and in which order they will be searched.</p>
