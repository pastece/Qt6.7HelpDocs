<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Morphing animation (also known as <i>vertex animation</i>) is a way to simulate deformations of soft materials. It transforms one shape smoothly into another. This is done by creating a mesh that contains multiple positions for each vertex. Each additional set of positions defines a shape, called a <a href="qml-qtquick3d-morphtarget.html" translate="no">morph target</a>. When animating, a <a href="qml-qtquick3d-morphtarget.html#weight-prop" translate="no">weight</a> is assigned to each target. The effective position of each vertex is calculated by linear interpolation between the positions for that target, according to the weights.</p>
<p>Morphing differs from <a href="quick3d-vertex-skinning.html" translate="no">skeletal animation</a> where we create an imagined skeleton, and rig the model by defining the relationship between each vertex of the model and the nodes of that skeleton.</p>
<p>Note that the fundamental structure of each morph target must be the same: If three vertices form a triangle in the base model, they will form a triangle in all the morph targets. The triangle can have a completely different position, orientation, and size; or it can even be effectively removed by making it a degenerate triangle with size zero.</p>
<p>In most cases, the mesh will be created by an external tool, and imported using the <a href="qtquick3d-tool-balsam.html" translate="no">Balsam</a> asset import tool. For example, in the Blender 3D editor, morph targets are called &quot;shape keys&quot;, and in Autodesk Maya they are called &quot;blend shapes&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a href="qtquick3d-morphing-example.html" translate="no">morphing example</a> shows how to control the weights of a model imported from Blender.</p>
<p>The <a href="qtquick3d-custommorphing-example.html" translate="no">custom morphing animation example</a> shows how to create a morph target in C++ by subclassing <a href="qquick3dgeometry.html" translate="no">QQuick3DGeometry</a>.</p>
